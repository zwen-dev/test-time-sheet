## Roadmap and releases

You can see a rough development roadmap in the [Milestones](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/milestones) sections.
It is open for changes and input from the community, your [ideas and questions](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/issues) are welcome.

> Kimai 2 uses a rolling release concept for delivering updates.
> You can upgrade Kimai at any time, you don't need to wait for the next official release.

Release versions will be created on a regular base (approx. one release per month) and you can use these tags if you are familiar with git.
Every code change, whether it's a new feature or a bug fix, will be done on the master branch. 
I have to do it this way, as I develop Kimai in my free time and want to put my effort into the software instead of backporting changes for old versions.
